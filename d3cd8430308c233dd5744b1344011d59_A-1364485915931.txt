There's no need for sarcasm.Did I EVER say that it would gunraatee a change? No.The point is, it lets them KNOW that people are unhappy.So what if people complain about it on the Internet? Most people on the Internet are ALWAYS unhappy, no matter what.*(*Just TRY and prove me wrong. You can't)It doesn't hurt anything to write in.Volume is the key. Now in a case like this, it probably won't change anything, but if enough people contact them they will know that people are unhappy with the whole Pixar-Canada thing.SOMETIMES writing letters does make a difference.As for Mr. Toad in WDW;If nothing else, there is a Toad tribute in the Pooh ride, so that acknowledges that they knew people would miss him. Besides, Mr. Toad's ride still exists in Disneyland.And hey, I'm not trying to be cold, I wish that The Country Bears were still at Disneyland.When imagineers remove an old attraction to put in a new one, theoretically, it should be &quot;better&quot; than the old one. Unfortunately, that is not always the case. Sometimes &quot;bad&quot; is just in the eye of the beholder, other times its obvious......Lets just hope with the new management those days are behind us.
