We tend to think that minteeg our goals to cnhage something in our lives leads directly to feeling fabulous.  But it also brings on less positive feelings, especially if it's a significant shift.Like anxiety    Woe, wait a minute, what happened to the way I used to do things?! I don't know this program.  Eek! Like regret    Why didn't I make this cnhage years ago? Like grief    To be this new person, I've got to let go of the old me, and there were things I liked about being her. I'll miss her. Talking about these feelings, reflecting on them, seems to be all that needs to be done about them, as long as you persevere with the new program.  You've done that here. Thanks for the refreshingly honest post!
