Coach Banks,If your season is that short you will detfeiinly need to compress that practice schedule down. We have always been able to get our  Sainted Six  series in in the first 3 weeks even for all rookie very young kids as well as the base defense with the base stunts. It really depends on the abilities and experience levels of your kids and the ages. Pages 147-148 of the book gives you a matrix of age, experience level and what football plays are right for that specific grouping of kids. Don't rush things, make sure you perfect the base series before you move on to the next series. That is a mistake so many youth football coaches make. Make sure and use the practice methodolgy in the book that should save you a ton of time so you can concentrate on fundamental skills, building proper technique and developing great execution of schemes, stunts and your football plays. You may have to give up running the full spinner and the jet stuff for now or add it in just before playoffs. Make sure you put the base adjustments in on page 189-194 first though. Only add these in, IF the kids are executing the other series well. In fact if you are playing a team for the second time in the playoffs, like many youth football teams do, this could be a huge advantage for you.
