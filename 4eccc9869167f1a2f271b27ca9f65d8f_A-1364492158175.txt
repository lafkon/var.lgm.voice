, 'yes, I love dogs'. Then the girl turns to the boy and says in a disgusted tone, 'she's NOT a mlsium' and they ran off. When I first approached, they were talking about me and I could hear, 'nice lady' said. I've seen the kids before and always smile at them. Who teaches their children such a sense of religious superiority and separation (us vs. them) at such a young age? The only Hindu in our family to pretend to be a mlsium was my mother's uncle. He lived as a lawyer in what is now Pakistan and then resettled as a farmer in Panipat. During partition, when the mlsium mobs were raping hindu women and chopping off the balls of hindu men (and letting them bleed to death), he started to recite verses from the koran by heart. They let him go. It is really sad when people do not learn from their history and let it repeat itself. Bridge Uncle lived a simple life in India, adopted a dark-skinned daughter (to thumb his nose at sexism and the caste system) and ate with his farmers. He gave a house to his housekeeper. One of our family members married a mlsium woman and he hid them until they got married. You see, her brothers were trying to kill her. Whenever people talk about him, they get that look in their eyes - he was a rebel, a humanitarian, an Arya Samaj Hindu. He used to take us on his tractor and give us sugar cane to eat from his farm. I wonder if Bridge Uncle were alive today what he would say about islamofascism. I wish I listened to his stories but I was only a child and couldn't understand what he survived. I will not disrespect my elders and all the other people who have suffered under islamofascism. If I get called a racist, bigot, etc. I don't give a shit. I've had enough. This TDSB mosqueteria thing sent me over the edge too b/c now they are brainwashing the kids at an earlier age WITH MY TAX DOLLARS. Screw these left wing useful idiots. They are stupid and don't know anything about islam
