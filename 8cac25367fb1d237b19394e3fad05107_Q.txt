CWD (April 20, 2012 at 2:48 pm)   It seems to me that Johnson did a bit more than  nothing  about the Liberty. That btaasrd set the ship up to be destroyed. Remember the bit about him saying he wanted it at the bottom of the sea?He didn't  do nothing . He was as involved as the members of his species that actually carried it out. He was the one who recalled the aircraft that were on their way to help. He was responsible for the threats made against the survivors. He was the one that intended to launch those nukes at Egypt as soon as he had confirmation that the Liberty had gone down with all hands.The kikenvermin in America are no different to the kikenvermin in tel aviv, They always work together against Humanity and life. It was a joint operation between Johnson and whichever sack of shit was ruling occupied Palestine at the time, both acting on orders from the devil itself, that creature known as rothschild.I'm not getting at you CWD, just pointing out the way it looks to me. Even people like Phil Tourney and Mark Glenn seem to think Johnson sat back and did nothing, but as far as I'm concerned that btaasrd (Johnson) knew exactly what the plan was before the Liberty even left the US.
