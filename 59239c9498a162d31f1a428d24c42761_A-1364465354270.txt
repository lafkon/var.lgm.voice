Gaming is my life I was in love with the idea of getting paid for teitnsg video games. Who ever come up with the idea is brilliant. I'm am very good with computers phone iPads and all that the fastest time I beat a game was in 3 hours and it was batman arkhum asylum. I love all types of games it is more of a passion then something to do when I have nothing to do. It's more of teitnsg the games then getting paid because there has been so many games the really dropped the ball or have failed to meat our expectation. I would like to get paid 5 dollars an hour. An I would more then love to work over time for gaming Maverick D. Parreott
