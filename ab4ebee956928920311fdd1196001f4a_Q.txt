ProtocolsR True (April 20, 2012 at 4:47 pm)   Someone I know has got one of those digital mosertonitiss, and the light output is much greater than that of an old CRT set, plus the programmers and advertisers are illegally inserting blinding flashes into practically everything on some channels.Deliberate flashing (not, not that sort    ) is illegal because it's dangerous, but who cares about what's legal any more? Laws only apply to the poor, and we're getting poorer every day.My theory is that those flashes, which are bright enough to hurt the eyes and cause headaches, are used to mask the subliminals. I'd like to get hold of one of those broadcasts and single-frame it to see what the hidden messages are.I don't really need to do that though. I've got the film  They Live  on the computer, and that gives a pretty good idea. Sleep. Don't think. Obey. I'd like to find some way of shutting the electric jew down, all over the country at the same time. Perhaps then the sheeple would wake up en-masse as the French might say and realise what's been done to them.There's no way of doing that, unfortunately, but sooner or later the power will be going out. Over the last few decades they've made us totally dependent on electricity for a reason. That reason is to give them even more power to make our lives miserable, but whenever the power does go down, and stays down, the electric jew won't work, so perhaps people will wake up when that happens. Hardship helps too. There's nothing like being forced to live on the outside of the system to show a person what that system's really like.      -Btw, since my reinstall yesterday, I'm now back to full functionality. Everything's installed and set up, and I've even got my e-mail working properly at last.
