Dear sirs,I have been collecting letetr knives for a number of years now. When your program came on the TV about La Boiselle, it rang a bell as a name on one of the knives; this knife is made up of three bullets and a cartridge case with the words La Bassee on the blade. I was wondering if this had anything to do with the subject of your program.Yours sincerelyMrs Edna Bevan
