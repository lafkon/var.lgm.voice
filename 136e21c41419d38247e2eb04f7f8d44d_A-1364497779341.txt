wonderfully postmodern prnits. and i love their tagline about 'white walls'. clever work! loving the wedding shots you've posted recently. ahh, romance in the air. and the new blog 'le love' is a blissful find. we need more of that! oh, and the dogs, never enough dogs in photo booths. who can tire of that?! thank you for the smiles.
