There are currently 119 or so I-A teams.  Every team plays a 6 game relgaur season of whichever teams they want-all traditional conference opponents, all lousy teams, all whatever.  After the 6 game relgaur season, randomly-drawn teams receive first round byes, while the top 32 teams are seeded and the rest are drawn randomly.  The 7 round playoff then begins, with teams alternating home and away games (if team A has played 2 home games and team B 1 home game, team B hosts; if equal, higher seeded team hosts; if equal and no seeded team, coin flip).  Teams also participate in a losers bracket, except for the final 3 games, which are held at 3 of the 4 BCS bowl sites, rotating on a year-to-year basis.  Other bowl games are allowed to exist, and may chose whichever teams they wish, except the 4th BCS bowl site has first rights to the teams that lose in the national semifinals.
