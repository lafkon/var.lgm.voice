Hacking is at risk but only the unethical astpces. Ethical hacking is still appropriate to a degree. I actually have my own blog and discuss these issues frequently.I'm not against anything or for it either normally but I find it difficult to find the ethics in hacking even ethical hacking. If the hacking is ethical I'm not concerned however, the integrity that goes or comes with the attempt to me is compromised. The what if? of possibilities come into play and very stringent ethics must remain intact to get through it.Hacking is not going out of style still, but the risky business of it makes it less attractive.
