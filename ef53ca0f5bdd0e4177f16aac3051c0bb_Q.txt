Hey Garret, I love your setup here man. Great work for sure. I have to agree that it is epic for PNP RPGs. I was hoping that you might be able to add aotnher feature for me. I am a minecraft player. Any chance you can add a feature to fill in the blocks? This would make planning my next structure extremely easy. Also, with that in mind  maybe expand the size so you can zoom in and out if the grid is HUGE..  Say maybe 500 x 500.  LOL
