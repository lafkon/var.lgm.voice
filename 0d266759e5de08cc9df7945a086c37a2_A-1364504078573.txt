My hubby and I try to do sweet things for each other here and there. It's the uneceextpd things that make the most impact. I am the same way with friends. If I see something that I think they might like I will buy it for them. I just ordered a framed photo collage for my friend who is expecting using photos I took at her shower a total surprize to her but something that made my day and that I know will make hers.
