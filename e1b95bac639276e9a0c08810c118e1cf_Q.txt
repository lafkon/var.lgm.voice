Trying to use this code in a very long-running CGI script as a viausl confirmation that the script is not hung. Script flushes its output repeatedly in order to insure Apache server serving it out does not time out waiting for the CGI script to complete.CGI initially outputs manual progress bar setup early in the page, and as soon as that part paints, I want the 0% bar to be visible.  manualPB2 = new JS_BRAMUS.jsProgressBar(  $( element1 ),  0,  {animate: true,showText: true,barImage: Array( images/bramus/percentImage_back4.png', images/bramus/percentImage_back3.png', images/bramus/percentImage_back2.png', images/bramus/percentImage_back1.png'),  }  );CGI next outputs two separate AND EMPTY  lists side-by-side.CGI then loops thru a list of several hundred data items and uses JavaScript to write  elements to one or the other of the  lists.  This fills in the  lists, and that part WORKS and no, I'm not asking for help on that part.   On each loop thru the data, the CGI script calculates the current percentage completed, and when it outputs the newest  element, it also outputs a call to your setPercentage() function to set the percentage complete.For example:setSelectOption( UL-DLT-SERVICE-MGT',  LEFT_SIDE');myJsProgressBarHandler.setPercentage( element1 , '70 );setSelectOption( UL-DLT-SERVICE-TEAMS',  RIGHT_SIDE');myJsProgressBarHandler.setPercentage( element1 , '73 );So as the select lists fill in, the progress bar increments.BUT The progress bar doesn't seem to move at all until all the writes in the loop are output, and then it starts producing incredibly large NEGATIVE values for the percentage and looping, filling in the bar RIGHT to LEFT (the negative?).  In the past 25+ minutes it's made it to -73K and still going strong.What am I doing wrong?
