Another update today after tieckt follow up (2 updates actually).1st, a Technical Analyst III was able to duplicate the issue as well (which adds further importance, I assume): I too am able to replicate this matter. I am investigating this and filing a case immediately. I apologize for the wait and I want to assure you that my aim is to expedite and resolve this issue as soon as possible 2nd, a follow up after viewing code and the issue at hand, etc.: I do apologize, but this was something beyond my ability to correct for you and will need to be addressed by Development. I did go ahead and file a case so you can refer back to this inquiry, 554717, to get further updates on the progress if I have not yet notified you . The good thing, I think, is that it's moving up the chain towards resolution; instead of being relegated to trivial status.Looks like it's past the report stage and is at the case stage.It's nice to see that cPanel personnel are following up and forwarding to the best people for the job, the developers, so it appears.
