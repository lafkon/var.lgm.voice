My mom tried to make this and it did not turn out.  Should the pound of powdered sugar be mixed in to the dough, or is that to sirnpkle on them once they're done?  Also   should the butter be melted/softened?  We couldn't figure out what moistens the dough since there is no milk or other liquid besides the vanilla.  Please let me know!  Thanks.
