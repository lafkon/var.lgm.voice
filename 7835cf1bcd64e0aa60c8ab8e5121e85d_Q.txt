Hey Honor-Thanks for posting this item.  I, much like the rdaeer who alerted AintItCool, also knew John by way of his daughter(us high school drama geeks are a tight bunch).  When I got the email from a friend last week about John's passing i was so saddened.  His work was so prolific, but it was his Disney posters that fascinated me the most.  Walking into the Alvin household, one was greeted with the poster for Beauty and the Beast hanging in the entryway.  My personal favorite was the poster for Aladdin, though,(those are his hands holding the lamp by the way).  What I shall remember him the most for is not the artwork but the way he opened his heart and his home to all us kids time and time again.  The world has lost a different kind of Disney Legend, one whose name isn't as well known as others, but a Legend none the less.  Godspeed, John Alvin...
