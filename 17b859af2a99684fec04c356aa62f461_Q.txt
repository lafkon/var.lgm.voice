Hi Tammy,thanks for your blog    I too am participating in Barb's race and was linkoog for some  real life' examples of people training and what they are doing, so thanks for your shares.I think I can relate to your trials and triumphs of trying to get it all in and still manage the details of a busy life!  The past 2 weekends I've done mock Olympic distance tri's (to prep for a real one I'm doing in 2 wks!), which has helped boost my confidence, but I still think I'm going to hit Barb's race nervous!  Seeing what others are doing, like yourself, helps me tweak my workouts for the next 2 weeks to maximize, so thanks for sharing!Good luck!Rebecca
