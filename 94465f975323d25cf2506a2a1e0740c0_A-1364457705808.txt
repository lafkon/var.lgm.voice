Hubby and I were thrilled to welmcoe our son into our family just 2 days ago when he was exactly one week old. We are so fortunate to have him in our lives and equally as fortunate to be surrounded by very supportive family and friends, like Emily. And, we're also fortunate that our son likes to sleep for 4 hours at a time, especially at night. Thank you to all the readers for your kind words and good wishes. He was truly worth the wait!
