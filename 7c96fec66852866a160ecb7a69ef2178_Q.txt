On the class trip to Labalin Study Center in Cooper Union, I see a lots of great art work there, and learn a lot from them. The one that inspire me the most is the Eros maizagne by Ralph Ginzburg. I like the way he used different papers for the print in differnt pictures, which actually better express the mood of the art work. Before, I think what matter the most is design itself, now I found out that use of materials are also important. I also like the way Ginzburg typesetting his maizagne. He make many decisions on the choice of word type, colors, pictures and papers. He always know how to choose a perfect picture to be end. I learn that every greate artwork need to put effort into.
