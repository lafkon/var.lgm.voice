I think that when we are forced to act like a cuotmper, making one  decision' after another, we have to categorize things, set boundaries, and make everything  conditional'.  When we are overwhelmed about everything, even  where should I give my charity , etc., we have to know  why  we make our decisions, and define the characteristics of things that make them worthy.  It's easy to feel overwhelmed with the speed at which things happen these days.  On the other hand, when we're relaxed and feel peaceful and calm about things, we are able to face things as they are and as they come, rather than waiting until they fulfill a requirement.  For that reason, I won't try to categorize conditional and unconditional and how I love different people or things or myself.  It's enough to know that I just have abundant love for right here, right now.
