You could always try. However, I wluodn't reccommend it unless you already have Odin working and the correct .tar recovery file to go with it. That's basically how I half-bricked my phone, and used Odin to un-brick it. So far, I haven't seen any kernels listed as ICS compatible. I had flashed Mijjz Blend, and then flashed the over-clocking kernel. What happened was the phone got stuck in an infinite boot after the flash, never getting past the Galaxy S screen. So, reasonably, I assume it's just a compatibility issue between the kernel and ICS roms. Unfortunately, I didn't know at the time that Clockworkmod had not been updated for use with ICS either. The Samsung recovery/download mode was still accessible though. And through Odin and .tar files I found linked from this site, I was able to flash the stock root rom from my computer to the phone and un-brick it.Hope this helps.
