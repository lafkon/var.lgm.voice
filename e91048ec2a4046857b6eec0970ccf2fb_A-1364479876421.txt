Going to the Cooper Union was a total new experience bsecuae I had never been to it before. It was amazing to see the sketches of the MTV logo that unfortunately it didn&rsquo;t work for the channel. Everything they have in their files makes you feel as if you were traveling back in time. Knowing that the magazines, posters, and books were all original pieces, I felt like in a museum of graphic design. I had a lot fun learning and seeing designs from the past that were actually designed using physical tool and not illustrator or Indesign or any other software.
