This is phantastic!Are there oterhe categories already?  Like date (today, yesterday, last week, older) or mime type (picture, text file, ODF sheet, ODF text documtent,  )?And other features come into mind (this is really inpireing):- opening and closing categories for faster navigation- if one has categories with more entries than fit on the screen, the user might get lost and does not know the current category (in the example of group by date above). In that case, it would help showing the current category somewhere What do you thing? Too many features might make the interface confusing
