Great post Don.Social media plays a major part in the search ennige rankings nowadays and will begin to play a larger role as Google+ integrates deeper and deeper into the SERPs.It makes sense though, if something is worth people's attention, people will share it, like it , mention it, whatever.I handle  and PPC management here in Fort Wayne and see social as being one of the largest parts of getting qualified traffic to our clients sites.Thanks for the post!
