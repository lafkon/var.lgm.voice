yes do not forget all the tignhs that have taken place in America just over the last few years. Another one overlooked as an advancement was the government ordered switch from analog television broadcasting to digital TV. The first thing I noticed in my rural area was that my analog tv antenna did not work anymore, even during weather emergencies when I knew my satellite signal would be knocked out. Most people in extreme rural areas now realize that your only chance for television is to pay a cable service if available or go satellite (plus satellite tax). But those who live in urban areas and cities get digital quality television broadcasts for free. Just make sure you watch NBC, CBS, ABC, PBS or any affiliate with them. Which means you-know-who completely controls every program and every commercial that these inner city dwellers watch in digital quality for free. With the 52 big screen tv they just bought with their earned income tax credit or their student loan money. Zog ownes them. You pay for it.
