Hello! I pasted here some information for you! It's from the text you get when putting 'man aptitude' into your command line: Description aptitude is a text-based interface to the Debian GNU/Linux package system. It allows the user to view the list of packages and to perform package management tasks such as installing, upgrading, and removing packages. Actions may be performed from a visual interface or from the command-line.
