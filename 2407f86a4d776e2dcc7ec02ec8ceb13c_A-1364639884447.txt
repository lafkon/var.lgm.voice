It looks like you know alot but sorry to say that you are terrible at tturoials. You move way too fast and do not even explain everything you are doing. I was so frustrated watching this. A tutorial should teach not just be a quick look at me do this complicated stuff fast. Besides this it seems you could really be an asset to the community.
