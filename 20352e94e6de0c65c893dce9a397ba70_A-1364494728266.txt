These posters are SO aminzag, excellent job! I know I would be more than happy to donate for the ability to download high-res versions of these posters, and I'm sure I speak for many others. I just realized the date of the concert is my actual birthdate, down to the year, so I am now TOTALLY committed to making this happen. I know plenty of artist have found ways to get around likeness issues; isn't there some sort of statue of limitations on this stuff?If anyone has any suggestions on places to write letters, Twitter campaigns etc, I would absolutely get on board.
