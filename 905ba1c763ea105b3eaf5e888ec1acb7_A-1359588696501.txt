None. You could theoretically learn how to drive a car without any lessons. You could teach yourself how to play a musical instrument just by messing with it.You could figure out how to set the clock on your microwave by hitting all of the buttons. You don't *need* to read any manuals, but it's usually the quickest route to productivity. :)
