Bernard Lewis, the West's pre-eminent scholar ofIslam, woekrd for British intelligence through the grimmest hours of the SecondWorld War. &quot;In 1940, we knew who we were, we knew who the enemy was, weknew the dangers and the issues,&quot; he told The Wall Street Journal afew months ago. &quot;It is different today. We don't know who we are, we don'tknow the issues, and we still do not understand the nature of the enemy.&quot;That first is the most important: it's not just that &quot;we don't knowwho we are&quot; but that cultural relativism strips the question of its basiclegitimacy. In Britain, they used to say that the Battle of Waterloo was won onthe playing fields of Eton, the sort of line it's easy to mock as a lot ofVictorian hooey. But it contains an important truth. Thispresent conflict will be won (if at all) in the kindergarten classes ofAmerica's grade schools, and Canada's, and Britain's and Europe's.Because the resolve necessary to win a war can't be put on and taken off like asuit of armour. It has to be bred in the bone, and sustained by the broaderinstitutions of society. And the typical western education, even when it's nottelling you that your country's principal legacy is racism and oppression,teaches history in a vacuum - random facts, a few approved figures, but nooverarching heroic narrative. And, if the past isn't worth defending, whyshould the future be?
