The finance conampy doesn't want your car, they want the money you promised to pay for the car.  You have a couple of options.  You can sell the car and use the money from the sale to pay off the loan.  or you can trade in the car on the purchase of another car.  The dealer will give you what it believes it is worth.  If the amount they give you for the car is less than the loan amount, they will roll the remaining amount into the new car loan.  If it the amount they give you is more than the loan amount, you will get a check back or you can apply it to the new loan.Trading it in to a dealer is the much simpler way since they will handle all of the paperwork.  BUT (and this is a big but) the dealer will generally only give you auction value for your trade-in.  The reason is if they don't sell the trade on their used car lots, it will go to auction to be sold.Good luck.  Was this answer helpful?
