who the hell cares???Hey Frenchie genius, have you nocteid he doesn&rsquo;t have a PREVIEW moron or a grammar check with the editor, there is a spell check, the squiggly red line under words that are misspelled. Which means unless you proof read every line that will happen??Otherwise it means you have to cut and past into Word, check the grammar, then cut and paste it back? Do you have 10 minutes for every post, Louise???These people wonder why they are loathed???What people are you referring to, the French or the Jew? Oh, I like the Louise comment too. Haven't heard that one since I was in the 2nd grade. I'll bet you never had an original thought in your whole life. Just so you know; Yes, I am French; A no, I am not a Jew. As for calling me a moron , that was rather rich. If the old addage holds any truth, your life must be quite blissful. The worst part about coming here and replying to your childish insults, is knowing that White folks are also reading it. My apologies to them, and INCOGMAN.
