When my daughters were ltltie, I wanted a shelf 7 feet off the ground where I could put all the things that I was constantly grabbing out of harms way, of either the item or the toddler! Not exactly good design, but ooh the sanity I imagined it would provide! Your home is beautiful! Love the vignette!Paula ~ Mise en sce8ne
