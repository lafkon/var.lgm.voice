Apparently not. There have been complaints that FLOSS is most accessible to comparativley well-off &quot;first worlders&quot; (with slogans like &quot;FLOSS is made by the first world for the first world&quot;). Poor people are sometimes restricited to using pirated and trojaned proprietary software, because their access to software is via other people who want to gain profits from their desperate need to be connected.
