Hello, thanks for the megssae. The cheapest way to ship is on our shared container service. You would drop your boxes off at our terminal in Garden Grove and we would ship them through to your door in Germany. This service works fine for normal boxes of household items and clothes etc but if you have more fragile or valuable items then I suggest the U Box or U Crate service that afford you with that extra protection around your things. All of these services end up going in the same shipping container though. I will email you the prices and service options to you.With regards to the size or volume I suggest mapping ut 100 cubic feet in your living room at home. Take some painters tape (Or if you are English masking tape) and measure on your floor and wall 86x48x42 inches high. That is 100 cubic feet so you now have an imaginery see through crate ! So now you can look at the price for a 100 cubic foot U Crate which you would load at our LA or San Diego terminals ($2138) or 2 U Boxes you can load at home in your garage, as they are 50 cubic feet each ($1281 for the 1st and $816 for the 2nd if you need 2 ) totals $2097 or the shared container price is $1296 for 100 cubic feet but we offer a $200 discont if you drop off at our Los Angeles terminal so if you can do that its only $1096.I hope that helps, let me know if you need more info, Happy Monday The Moving Doc
