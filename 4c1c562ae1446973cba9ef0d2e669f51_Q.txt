wnfEDkz5P044Hello there, I have an e-machineModel# ET1831-05.Do you work on those machines?I also have a coopun for the$160.00 package.I don't know if you can help me but my cp runs very slow even though I have high speed turbo. The cursor will jump around when I try to type a document. I also had a hp before that was going wonky on me so I bought the e machine but I had them do a back up for me and I am wondering if the hp had a virus and then transferred into my new one. I forgot to delete all my email and Facebook notifications and they entered all those into my new one. My computer is a mess. I have old pictures that I wanted to keep sitting in my document files and old emails sitting in my picture files.Do you think you can help me???I also have Kaspersky and also had it on my old hp.Can't wait to hear back from you.Thank you,Angie
