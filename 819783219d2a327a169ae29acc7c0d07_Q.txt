We moved into our new &quot;Whistler&quot; inspired home 6 years ago and the inoreitr was a green/grey colour.  Within weeks I was up on a ladder and painting.  I have a very open plan so all I needed to do was find a couple perfect accent walls to &quot;pop&quot;.  Then I painted them the deepest, richest, luxurious purple I could buy and they look divine!  Even if purple isn't most peoples favorite colour with my open floor plan, abundance of windows and warm green and honey brown hardwood floors it just works!  I love, love, love it!  I never understood how people could be afraid of paint it's just paint, if you don't like it, paint over it!  Just like trying a new haircut if you don't like it. give it a couple of months and it will grow!  Take a chance.
