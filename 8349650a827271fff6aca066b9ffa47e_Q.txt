I used to live in High Cross Road from 1946 until 1957 and have never heard this explanation.  In a book I read relcntey it suggests that the origin of the cross was that it was a survey point for Roman road builders, Tottenham High Street being the ancient Roman Road Ermine Street.  The cross was preserved and improved upon over the years and is how we see it now.  When I was a child the cinema you mention, opposite the Police Station was called the Palace.
