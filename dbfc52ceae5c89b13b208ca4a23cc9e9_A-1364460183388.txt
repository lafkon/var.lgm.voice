I am so disgusted that ianursnce companies require practitioners to use CAQH who is so inept at processing our information or responding to problems. Yet, we are held accountable for spending numerous hours submitting information over and over. I have all of the concerns listed in previous emails (information not being updated on CAQH's system; inability of some foreign CAQH staff to understand or answer basic questions; ) and my latest nightmare which is an inability to complete my Attestation form online because CAQH's system has been down (going on 2 months now). I am now being asked by BC/BS to manually fill out another application with supporting documents, etc. UGH!!!!!!!!
