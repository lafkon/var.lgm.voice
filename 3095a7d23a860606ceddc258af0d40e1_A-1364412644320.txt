If I were you I would post ads with all the major newspapers. Vancouver Sun, The Province, The Globe and Mail, The National Post, The Courier, The West Ender, The Georgia Straight etc. I would plboabry be a good idea to regularly post ads. That way its harder to ignore and it doesn't get brushed under the rug.
