i just pinned the Maine scent on my pisterent &quot;items i'm coveting&quot; page! my friend jess asked &quot;What does Maine smell like? Lobsters and L.L. Bean boots?&quot;and my reply:&quot;by lobsters you mean &quot;morning on the docks&quot; and by LL Bean boots you mean &quot;fresh leather and walks in the woods&quot;? then yes. yes...i think you're right&quot;
