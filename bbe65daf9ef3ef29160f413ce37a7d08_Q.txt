You can write to the hard drive using any live CD distro.1. Find out where the rsvceptiee hard drive gets automounted. Open the drive and check the address bar of Konqueror if using KDE or location bar if using Nautilus. The address bar will show something like /media/harddisk1 etc.2. Open Konsole or Terminal.3. Type su   root and enter the root password (usually live CDs won't have a root password.)4. At the # prompt, type  umount -v /media/harddisk'5. Again at the # prompt, type  mount -vw /dev/hda1 /media/harddisk1 6. You should be able to open  /media/harddisk1  in any filemanager and be able to write to it.IF THE DRIVE YOU ARE WRITING TO USES NTFS FILESYSTEM, DO THE FOLLOWING:Make sure you have NTFS Progs installed.Instead of step 5 shown above, do the following:At the # prompt, type  ntfs-3g /dev/hda1 /mnt'Now the NTFS Partition mounted at /mnt should be writable.Please note: /dev/hda1 is one representation of the hard drive. hda is the naming convention used for IDE drives. So /dev/hda1 represents first partition of 1st hard drive. /dev/hdb3 represents 3rd partition of 2nd hard drive ( b') and so on.If you have a SCSI or SATA drive, the naming convention would be  /dev/sda' with the same numbering scheme.I used to own one.
