thanks for your kind remarks. I was loinkog for an opportunity to say hey but the McGee's were very popular. No worries. Glad you enjoyed the photos. I love to capture the emotion of the evening. Nothing more fun than great music and being allowed to photograph. I'm trying to inch my way into the profession of concert photography. I currently work a lot with my son and his friends at the helping to promote their bands. I'm sure Nicole will keep me apprised of PRH's next gigs and look forward to seeing you guys play again. I will have to make it a date night as I know my wife would greatly enjoy your style.@ Mrs. McGee, thank you also and very nice meeting you. I will be in touch about getting you some photos.@ Matt, glad you enjoyed the photos ..and the show!
