I`ve never asked for your perfection...in fact that is shmntoieg that i cannot offer you...if you ever believed that i am...its no true...its shmntoieg that maybe i want you to believe...but in fact i have some many fears and doubts inside of me....so many things that i want you to know...to share with you... Perfection for me is to know every little detail of you and to feel that you know every detail of me too...and to feel that we alone are never going to achieve that perfection...but together we can feel truly complete...This last days were shmntoieg different in the way...but i still feel that we have shmntoieg unique and really worth fighting for....and with time we will build our own perfection.....from someone who woke up today wanting nothing else in the world but you....;)
