They aren't bad. In the short term they can even be the better solution. However you're dependant on one company to develop the tools you're using. This can work ok but you don't have much influence over the direction those tools go. Also you are helpless if the company goes bankrupt, is bought by another company or simply discontinues the product (or service).
