Hey, I might be able to help here.  Everybody is different.  I find that if I wake up in the mdldie of the night &amp; take a my pain killers &amp; I can fall back asleep, but if I woke up because of my kidneys &amp; take a pain killer &amp; I can fall asleep again, but if I wake up because I've been laying to long I find if I take a pain killer  (I take vicodin for the Spinal Stenosis) I go to the bathroom &amp; then take my comforter and cover up with it on the recliner I can fall asleep. So if  you can make any sense of that at all.  OMG I'm so losing it.  Are we laughing yet?  I am I'm such a ditz some times.  LOL  WHO LUVS YA BABY!  FEEL BETTER! Soft hugs &amp; smooches! CM
