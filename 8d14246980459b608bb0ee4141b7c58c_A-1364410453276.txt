One thing I found (but my experience is quite litmeid) is that when you post on non-busy streets signs are less likely to be torn down. I have posted on streets like Main and 12th they get torn down within a few days. If I post in less busy streets the signs stay up much longer. I hope this helps.Also, it would probably be a good idea to post stuff up in residential areas near where he was last seen. People in that neighborhood may have seen him before he disappeared.
