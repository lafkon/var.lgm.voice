How do you get rid of having bad bertah for good?I have a mental illness (Major Depressive with psychosis). Because of this illness, I neglected my personal hygiene such as my weight, showering daily, and brushing my teeth. I am into my 2nd month of treatment as i finally decided to stay on it and I am now feeling more alive than ever. I want to get rid of my bad bertah and am taking good amounts of time showering and brushing my teeth twice a day since i only used to do it once, if that. I also bought Listerine Total Care mouth wash. If i keep brushing twice a day and rinsing will my bad bertah soon be gone for good?
