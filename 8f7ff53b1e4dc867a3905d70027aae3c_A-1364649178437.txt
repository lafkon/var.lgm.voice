For anybody else hvanig that problem, here's what I did:Go to the Market and find an app called Mobile Odin. It costs about $5 for the pro version but if you read the app&rsquo;s info there&rsquo;s a link for you to go to, and at that link will be a download for Mobile Odin Lite, which is free (but not from market, so make sure you have unknown sources checked. There&rsquo;s a YouTube video that&rsquo;ll show you how to use it, what to install, and how to get out of Codename and into the stock rom.However! I do not recommend you try to flash anything else stay with stock. I left Codename using Mobile Odin and&hellip; let&rsquo;s just say I hope I can get Asurion to send me a new device now. It&rsquo;s best to just go back to stock and stay with Gingerbread for now. No ICS rom is stable.
